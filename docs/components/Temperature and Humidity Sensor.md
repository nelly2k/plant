![DHT11](./img/DHT11.jpg)

This sensor module utilizes DHT11 as the sensitive component and has a bypass capacitor and a pull-up resistor on-board. The DHT11 is a pre-calibrated digital output temperature and humidity sensor. The single-wire wiring scheme makes it easy to be integrated to other applications. The simple communication protocol greatly reduces the programming effort required.
